This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in PHP programming involving loose comparison (`==`) between integers and empty strings. The `bug.php` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`). Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs that are difficult to track down.  Always prefer strict comparison (`===`) in PHP to avoid such issues, especially when dealing with mixed data types.
