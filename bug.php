This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and loose comparison.  The `if` condition `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing different types. In this specific scenario,  an integer 0 and an empty string '' are considered equal under loose comparison, but not under strict comparison. This might lead to unintended execution of the code block within the `if` statement even when you'd expect it to be skipped.
